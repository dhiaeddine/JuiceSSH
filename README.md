JuiceSSH Issue Tracker
========

When raising a new issue please ensure to be descriptive of the situation when the problem occurs.

Please also include a debug log - you can generate one within JuiceSSH by doing:

1. Repeat whatever action causes the problem/crash
2. Go to **Main Menu -> Settings** and long press the **Version** item at the bottom of the list
3. This will bring up a debug log viewer - you can either email to us, or paste into an issue on here.
